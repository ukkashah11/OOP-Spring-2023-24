                     When you declare a static member variable like static int count; inside a class, 
                     you're telling the compiler about the existence of this variable, 
                     but you're not actually defining itâ€”i.e., you're not allocating storage for it. 
                     The scope resolution operator is used outside the class definition
                     to define and allocate storage for this static member. 
                     This definition is crucial for the program to link successfully, 
                     as it resolves the storage location for the static variable.
